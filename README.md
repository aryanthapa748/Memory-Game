# Memory-Game

## **Memory Game 🎴**
A simple and interactive memory game created using JavaScript! This game challenges your memory by flipping over cards to match pairs.

## **📝 Game Description**
In this game, there are 12 cards laid out in a grid. Each card has a hidden image or symbol, and the goal is to find all matching pairs by flipping over two cards at a time. If the two cards match, they stay flipped. If they don't, they turn back over after a short delay.

## **🚀 How to Play**
Click on any card to reveal the hidden symbol or image.
Try to find the matching card by flipping over another one.
If the cards match, they stay visible. If they don't, they will flip back down after a short delay.
Continue until all pairs are matched.

## **🛠️ Built With**
This game was built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key JavaScript methods and techniques used include:

- querySelector and querySelectorAll: To select and manipulate elements.
- createElement(): To dynamically generate card elements.
- setAttribute() and getAttribute(): To handle custom attributes for the cards.
- setTimeout(): To add a delay when flipping cards back over for non-matches.

## **🤔 Future Enhancements**
Add difficulty levels with more cards.
Add a timer to track the time taken to complete the game.
Implement score tracking to track the player's performance.
